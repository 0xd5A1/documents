# The bStable DAO

bStable’s stablecoin AMM and its ‘savings accounts’ along with its payment protocol are built to be decentralized, community-owned, non-custodial products which can be integrated into other decentralized finance products. As such, the goal of the bStable team is to ultimately hand over governance of the protocols to the community of BST holders, while continuing to update the user interface and develop new products on top of the core payment protocols.

While the DAO won’t be live upon launch, it is scheduled to go live within 2021.&#x20;

Once it is live, the bStable DAO will make decisions regarding any potential changes to the protocol, including but not limited to changes to the fee structures, reserve allocation, and BST distribution.
