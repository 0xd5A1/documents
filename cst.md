# CST

**The bStable DAO token (BST) is a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain that will act as the governance token for the bStable DAO. BST will also incentivize participation in the protocol through Pay to Earn**

## **Use Cases**

Soon, BST holders will also be able to use BST for the following:

* **Governance voting**: Governance will be implemented on two levels via a DAO: product-level governance and finance-level governance. \
  \
  Product-level governance will allow BST token holders to govern key protocol parameters of specific products, while finance-level governance will allow BST token holders to govern how the portfolio of BST products interoperates.\

* **'Membership' Discounts**: Users who hold a certain amount of BSC token will benefit from discounts on bStable’s fees.\

* **Paying for protocol fees**: Users will be able to pay bStable’s protocol fees in BST itself.

## **Basics**

* Block Rewards: 6.5 BST/Block
* Block Time: 3 seconds/Block
* Total supply: around 118 million
* Dev Fund: for every 1 BST minted, an extra 0.1 BST is minted for the dev fund.

## **Details**

The BST token's contract has built-in scarcity and is meant to make BST creation gradually slow down. According to the contract, BST will be distributed as follows:

* 10,000,000 BST will be pre-mined on launch day and will be distributed primarily among institutional investors (6,000,000 BST). The rest will be used for initial operations such as IFOs (Initial Farm Offerings) and other marketing activities (4,000,000 BST).\

* For the first 'quarter' of a year (91.25 days) after launch (starting on May 18th, 2021), 6.5 BST will be minted per block. \
  \
  At a rate of 28,800 blocks per day, a total of 17,082,000 BST will be minted in the first 91.25 days.\

* On every 'quarter' thereafter, the BST minted per block will be divided by $$2^{1/4}$$ or 1.18920711500272\
  \
  In total, excluding the 10,000,000 pre-mine and the extra 10% for the developer fund, **53,682,008** **will have been minted a year after BST's launch.**

In other words, on launch, 6.5 BST will be created in every block on Binance Smart Chain. Gradually each quarter, the amount of BST created in every block will reduce.&#x20;

### Development Fund

In addition, for every 1 BST minted, an additional 0.1 BST (10%) will be minted and set aside in a development fund to ensure the long-term viability, growth, and sustainability of bStable.

### Total BST issuance

**The total distribution**, including the dev fund and the initial launch day release, will be as follows. For the purpose of this demonstration, the table below only shows BST issuance for the next 4 years. The chart below shows BST issuance for the next 8 years and shows the curve of diminishing BST issuance as it becomes more scarce over the years.

### BST issuance formula

y: BST per block

n: period defined by each quarter of a year or 91.25 days

The reduction coefficient is $$2^{1/4} = 1.18920711500272$$&#x20;
