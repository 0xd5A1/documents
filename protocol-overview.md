## Payments <a href="#payments" id="payments"></a>

CStable's payment protocol is the main innovation by the CStable team and the main differentiator from other DeFi products.CStable payment protocol is its introduction of '**Pay to Earn**'. Anytime someone uses CStable's Pay feature they receive will receive a reward in CST, the CStable DAO governance token.As of launch, CStable's payment feature is limited to sending payments. The pay feature currently supports CUSD, USDT, and USDC but will support more currencies in the future as more DEXs are integrated into the payment protocol. In the future, CStable's payment feature will be extended to an integrate-able payment widget, as well as other formats, including seller tools. CStable's payment feature's goal is to make payments free, easy, and trustless while rewarding those who use it.
