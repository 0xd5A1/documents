The pay feature currently supports USDC, USDT, and BUSD but will support more currencies in the future as more DEXs are integrated into the payment protocol. In the future, bStable's payment feature will be extended to an integrate-able payment widget, as well as other formats, including seller tools. bStable's payment feature's goal is to make payments free, easy, and trustless while rewarding those who use it.
