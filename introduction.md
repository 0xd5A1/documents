# Introduction

In crypto, change is constant. The price volatility of most cryptocurrencies has hindered the development of decentralized finance. Because of this, Stablecoins have become an essential ingredient of the crypto pie and have been one of the main foundations upon which DeFi has been built on so far.

Hundreds of DeFi products across blockchains rely on stablecoins as safe-haven assets and hundreds of thousands of users are already using decentralized protocols to earn a higher interest on their stablecoins than is possible on their fiat. While stablecoins and DeFi have opened the doors to a new world of finance, there are many financial processes that remain undisrupted by stablecoins and cryptocurrency in general.

Cryptocurrency payment solutions, for example, have yet to gather mass adoption. CStableâ€™s strives to fill this gap with a **payment solution that is trust-less and non-custodial, and easy to use.**&#x20;
