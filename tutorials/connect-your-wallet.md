# Connect Your Wallet

CStable currently supports connections from a variety of wallets. While tutorials are only currently available for MetaMask, there will be tutorials for more wallet types in the future.

### Step 1: Connect Your Metamask Wallet with BSC

If you don’t already have a Metamask Wallet, check their [official website here](https://metamask.io)!

Once Metamask Wallet is set up, open it and select network.

**Network name:** Celo (Mainnet)

**ChainID:** 42220

**Symbol:** CELO

**Block Explorer URL:** [https://explorer.celo.org](https://explorer.celo.org)

Make sure you **deposit some CELO** into your wallet on the Celo Blockchain Network and you will be ready to go!
